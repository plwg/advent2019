** Day 1

Recursion does the trick.

** Day 2

- ~intList = list(map(int, stringList))~ to convert a list of string
  to list of int.
- recursion does the trick again.
- Another thing to note is using ~copy.deepcopy()~ to create a copy of
  a list (reference type)

** Day 3

   There might be a better data structure for the paths - I chose to
   record every point that it crossed. The data size is not that big
   so performance was ok. I did encounter performance issue trying to
   find the common coordinates of the two paths. At first, I was
   using:

   #+begin_src python
   listOfCross = []
   for point in firstCoordinates:
       if point in secondCoordinates:
           listOfCross.append(point)
   #+end_src
   
   It was slow. A bit of research and I found [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2864842/common-elements-comparison-between-2-lists][this thread]] on StackOverflow

   #+begin_src python
   listOfCross = list(set(firstCoordinates).intersection(secondCoordinates))
   #+end_src
   
   Neat.
